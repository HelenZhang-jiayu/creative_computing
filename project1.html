“kuai qi lai le&#33;” (“wake up, hurry&#33;”)</p>
<p>
My mum opened the door and shook my body.<br>
I opened my eyes<br>
and saw the familiar white closet.
I stretched my body<br>
and flipped to another side.</p>
<p class="right">
<br>
<br>
<br>
I had family breakfast with steam dumplings<br>
I was expecting lamb with carrot last night<br>
My mother totally got my appetite.</p>
<p class="right">
Every morning was a surprise for my stomach<br>
There was no tedious thing to take up my delighted brain.</p>
<p class="right">
I walked through Hutong<br>
to sit in lines.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
I had spicy dry pot at the school restaurant with Barbara<br>
The soft konjaku<br>
The crunchy greens<br>
The red spice<br>
The vinegar topping<br>
And it was perfect with hot rice.</p>
<p class="center">
<br>
<br>
I walked across the hutong<br>
to sit in lines again.</p>
<p class="center">
I fell asleep at literature class<br>
while Ms. Fourquean was reading “The Bait”</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
I dreamed about growing up<br>
and having lectures in college<br>
Excitement filled my brain.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="right">
I opened the glass door and entered the password<br>
While smelling the hot chicken soup that takes 5 hours to stew<br>
Hot steam of fresh chicken corn and seaweed covered my eyes.</p>
<p class="right">
I woke up at “6:30”<br>
And walked through the Hutong again<br>
Carrying a 1000 pages calculus textbook<br>
I said goodbye and see you in the afternoon<br>
when I got off the car.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
We ran 800 meter in PE class<br>
I tasted the blood in my throat<br>
Telling myself it was the last lap.</p>
<p>
I put my exhausted arm on Barbara’s shoulder<br>
Her height is perfect to relax.</p>
<p>
We had Green Scream (an energy drink)<br>
in the small market next to our building<br>
And sneaked inside.</p>
<p>
I bend over on my desk<br>
My legs are sore<br>
I could still feel the sickness.</p>
<p class="right">
<br>
<br>
I had rice noodle in classroom instead<br>
It was the first time I finished the big serve<br>
It healed my exhaustion.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="center">
It was rainy when we heard the ring<br>
But we all couldn’t wait to get back home<br>
Raindrops dropped in my eyes<br>
I was supposed to arrive home<br>
But I didn’t.</p>
<br>
<p class="center">
It is a dream<br>
The raindrops are tears rushing the shore.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="right">
I question the reality<br>
I don’t want to believe in it.<br>
Or I am right.<br>
I doubt my ability<br>
I doubt the future.<br>
Smoke around my eyes<br>
I am breathing hard.<br>
Am I falling into an abyss of consciousness&#63;<br>
Or the feeling of missing.<br></p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="center">
What if I am a child who was abandoned by her own past&#63;</p>
<p class="center">
What if I can’t wake up again&#63;</p>
<p class="center">
What if the shining stars on the ocean disappear and there won’t be any glitter on the ocean waves&#63;</p>
<p class="center">
What if the warm fire surrounding me extinguished before I am strong enough to face<br>
The Darkness&#63;</p>
