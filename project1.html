<h1><i>6:30</i></h1><br>
<br>
6:30am
“kuai qi lai le&#33;” (“wake up, hurry&#33;”)
My mum opened the door and shook my body.
I opened my eyes 
and saw the familiar white closet.
I stretched my body 
and flipped to another side.
I had family breakfast with steam dumplings
I was expecting lamb with carrot last night
My mother totally got my appetite.
Every morning was a surprise for my stomach
There was no tedious thing to take up my delighted brain.
I walked through Hutong
to sit in lines.
I had spicy dry pot at the school restaurant with Barbara
The soft konjaku
The crunchy greens
The red spice
The vinegar topping
And it was perfect with hot rice.
I walked across the hutong
to sit in lines again.
I fell asleep at literature class while Ms. Fourquean was reading “The Bait”
I dreamed about growing up and having lectures in college
Excitement filled my brain.
I opened the glass door and entered the password
While smelling the hot chicken soup that takes 5 hours to stew
Hot steam of fresh chicken corn and seaweed covered my eyes.
I woke up at “6:30”
And walked through the Hutong again
Carrying a 1000 pages calculus textbook
I said goodbye and see you in the afternoon when I got off the car.
We ran 800 meter in PE class
I tasted the blood in my throat
Telling myself it was the last lap.
I put my exhausted arm on Barbara’s shoulder
Her height is perfect to relax.
We had Green Scream (an energy drink) in the small market next to our building
And sneaked inside.
I bend over on my desk
My legs are sore
I could still feel the sickness.
I had rice noodle in classroom instead
It was the first time I finished the big serve
It healed my exhaustion.
It was rainy when we heard the ring
But we all couldn’t wait to get back home
Raindrops dropped in my eyes
I was supposed to arrive home
But I didn’t.<br>
<br>
It is a dream
The raindrops are tears rushing the shore.<br>
<br>
I question the reality
I don’t want to believe in it.
Or I am right.
I doubt my ability
I doubt the future.
Smoke around my eyes
I am breathing hard.
Am I falling into an abyss of consciousness&#63;
Or the feeling of missing.
What if I am a child who was abandoned by her own past&#63;
What if I can’t wake up again&#63;
What if the shining stars on the ocean disappear and there won’t be any glitter on the ocean waves&#63;
What if the warm fire surrounding me extinguished before I am strong enough to face 
The Darkness&#63;
